            <p id="para">We know the struggles of life when you have no job, no money, and 
                sometimes even no home. Many of our people have been in those unfortunate situations. But we all overcame them
                and we believe that everyone else has the potential to do so too. We make content and connections for people
                to improve themselves. We are passionate about people making the most of their lives, and aim to inspire and guide
                as many indivdiuals as we can!</p>
